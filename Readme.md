# Algorithms

## Purpose
I implemented some algorithms and created some tests to prepare for an exam at university. I saved them in this repo.
This is not suitable to be used in production or anywhere. Questions and improvements are still welcome, though!

## How to run the tests
```sh
# clone repository, cd in there
npm install
npm run test
```
